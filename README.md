# UI/UX Design Components

A collection of UI/UX design components. This repository focuses on design exploration, prototyping, and the application of design principles. Components here are experimental and intended for learning purposes.

## üé® In Progress

This repository is a work in progress as I explore the world of user interface and user experience design. New components, design patterns, and prototypes will be added as I continue my study and experimentation. The goal is to apply what I learn to create visually appealing, user-friendly, and functional UI components.

## üìÇ Structure

Each component folder may contain the following:

- **`design.fig`**: Figma file containing the component design.
- **`style.css`**: The CSS file for styling the component.
- **`script.js`**: The JavaScript file implementing any interactive functionality.
- **`images/`**: Folder with preview images, icons, or other assets related to the component.
- **`README.md`**: Brief overview of the design, concept, and implementation of the component.

Feel free to explore the files to understand the design, styles, and functionality behind each component.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

To view or edit the designs:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the Figma files (`.fig`) directly from the repository.
3. You can also export any design assets or images for your projects.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ui-design-lab.git
cd ui-design-lab/button
